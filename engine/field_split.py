"""Shared-AcroForm-field split — shim over the shared ``maine-forms-engine``.

The implementation lives in ``maine_forms_engine.fill.field_split``; this
module keeps the repo's ``engine.field_split`` API stable and re-anchors the
default forms tree to THIS repo's layout. See the package docstring for the
fan-out problem (one field, semantically different boxes) this solves.
